    "#### 1  (20 points) What is the time complexity of your algorithm? In terms of number of evaluations. If you cannot compute time complexity in general, answer a simpler version of the question: \n",
    "For the simple one hill problem, the time complexity, as measured by number of evalution calls was measured with the following method.\n",
    "\n",
    "For 100 solution attempts with initial conditions of unbiased random bit vectors, the total number of evalautions was 38073, summing across all attempts. All attempts were successful. That is 380.73 evaluation calls per solution. I have run other trials attempting to improve this, but this was the best version.\n",
    "Because the initial conditions are uniformly distributed without bias, the expected value of the Hamming distance between the initial and solution vectors is the average number of moves required. In this case, E|H(Initial,Final)| = 50. Therefor, the algorithm solves on average 50 necessary moves with 380.73 evaluation calls. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a reasonable and practical solution efficiency, but is sub optimal. The expected value of the Hamming distance is a good metric against which to judge, as is the state vector size of 100. Single hill variant ought to be solvable with an average number of solution attempts somewhere closer to the state vector length. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2 (10 points) What is the space complexity? \n",
    "\n",
    "From a guppy report of memory usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "Partition of a set of 282117 objects. Total size = 33617898 bytes.\n",
    " Index  Count   %     Size   % Cumulative  % Kind (class / dict of class)\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm uses 33617898 bytes of memory. This is a rather constant amount of memory used between iterations. I observed less than 1 kB variation betweeen iterations.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3 Is the algorithm complete? \n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, the algorithm is complete, in the sense that it will find any solution of the class of either problem. If the bit order were to be randomized, the algorithm would still successfully find the optimum. If the number of bits in the information sparse sector of the 100 bit code were changed, the algorithm would auto calculate these bits and locations arbitrarily distributed throughout the bit string, adjusting the search space. All locations of known bits and information sparse bits are determined on the fly. The algorithm can optomize problems of this class well, but is not time efficient for other classes of state space with varying degrees and topologies of fitness information. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Is the algorithm guaranteed to find the optimum?\n",
    "Yes. Even if it gets stuck, it will enumerate every remaining untested solution, maximizing information usage, and iterate through the entire state space as necessary to determine a solution. Potential errata behavior if state space exceeds ordinary local file system and memory limitations. \n",
    "\n",
    "The search space is very large for the part 2 question. System hardware limitations may be a factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### If the algorithm finds the optimum, will it find it minimum time? \n",
    "Well, a hash map would be faster. Or an Oracle machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Low hanging fruit to improve this algorithm close to idea would be to not evaluate previously changed bits, with a registry type technique for known bits similar to what I used in part 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "To more thoroughly answer this, I must make an assumption about \"minimum time\". I will assume minimum time means the average number of evaluation calls, from several trials from a random starting position, with potentially shifted or rearranged bits. This would apply for either class of problem, 'eval' or 'eval1'. \n",
    "\n",
    "For class of eval like problems, the information dense state space, this will find the answer in more than the minimum number of evaluation calls, compared to other algorithms that will solve this complete class of problems as defined above.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the class of eval1 like problems, it is difficult for me to ascertain exactly what the minimum size is, for every approach. I cannot say exactly what the fitness information from eval1 is for the entire space. Therefor I cannot make concrete statements about what minimum time is. Practically speaking, the read/write locks on the files used to transfer data between python and c slow operation. Properly multi threaded optimized could would be faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the way I coded several items to auto adjust sizes of information dense and sparse bitspace and check stalled hill climbers results in evaluations that are not absolutely necessary\n"
